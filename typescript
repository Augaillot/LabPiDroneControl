smbus-cffi                - This Python module allows SMBus access through the I2C /dev interface on Linux hosts. The host kernel must have I2C support, I2C device interface support, and a bus adapter driver.
pyblinkm                  - Drive a BlinkM with Python via I2C using python-smbus on Raspberry Pi.
pysmbus                   - Pure Python implementation of the I2C SMBus protocol.
smbus2                    - smbus2 is a drop-in replacement for smbus-cffi/smbus-python in pure Python
Adafruit-PureIO           - Pure python (i.e. no native extensions) access to Linux IO including I2C and SPI.  Drop in replacement for smbus and spidev modules.
